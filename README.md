# DUOS Mail

Just a little script to run on a schedule, directing subjects of the DUOS Project's research to its [web interface](https://duosproject.github.io//).

### Usage

If you have Pipenv, then running...

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

...will get your environment set up.  
If you don't have Pipenv, give it a [shot](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)!

`python main.py` will get you going, but unless you [build](https://github.com/ainsleymcgrath/duos-cli) the database locally, not much is gonna happen. :)
